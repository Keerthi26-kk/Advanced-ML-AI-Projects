AI-Powered Solutions: Image-Based Product Search & Customer Support Chatbot

Overview

This repository contains two AI-driven projects designed to enhance user experience through machine learning and natural language processing:

Image-Based Product Search ‚Äì A deep learning model for retrieving visually similar products based on image inputs.
AI-Powered Customer Support Chatbot ‚Äì An NLP-based chatbot that efficiently responds to customer queries.


1Ô∏è‚É£ Image-Based Product Search

Project Description
This project utilizes VGG16 to extract deep image features and applies cosine similarity to find visually similar products. It is designed for e-commerce platforms to improve product discovery.

Technologies Used
TensorFlow, Keras (VGG16)
Image Preprocessing (load_img, img_to_array)
Cosine Similarity for similarity matching
Implementation Steps
Load and preprocess images.
Extract feature embeddings using VGG16.
Compute cosine similarity between images.
Retrieve and display the most similar products.


2Ô∏è‚É£ AI-Powered Chatbot for Customer Support

Project Description
This chatbot uses TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to analyze customer queries and provide the most relevant responses, enhancing automated customer support.

Technologies Used
Natural Language Processing (NLTK)
TF-IDF for text vectorization
Cosine Similarity for query-response matching
Pandas & NumPy for data handling
Implementation Steps
Preprocess customer queries.
Convert text data into numerical form using TF-IDF.
Compute cosine similarity to find the best-matching response.
Return an automated response based on similarity scores.
